The purpose of this web-ap is to test the strength of passwords. The web-app displayes the srength of the password to the user in two ways:
- A table situated under the password entry field
- Changing the colour of lights in SMB109. 

## Features

- Ability to control the lights in SMB109. 
- Ability to display the strong password features present in the users password. 

### Checks for 
- Password length 
- Multi-case (Upper and Lower case characters) 
- Presence of Special characters 
- Alphanumeric (Numbers and letters)
- Repeating characters 

## Pages 

### Common 

All pages have the navbar at the top. The navbar has been keptintentionally simple as it makes the web-app look cleaner in my opinion.

All pages contain a footer. This footer states that the page was created using [w3.css](https://www.w3schools.com/w3css/). The footer also acts as a link to the w3.css site.

This is the first page that the user is greeted with upon opening the web-app. It contains the web-apps title (Password Strength Tester) and the creator's (my) name.

### About Page 

This is the about page for the web-app. The purpose of this page is to tell the user about the application and the creator. The page is split into two sections:

- About the application 
- About the creator 

These two sections are composed of a title, and a paragraph telling the user about that section.

### Application Page

This is the application page for the web-app. This page contains the main functionality of the site, it is on this page where the user is able to enter there password, and view the results. Both the password entry box and the results table are held on this page as that allows the table to be updated live.

This is the application key page. It contains the key for the lights in SMB109. The page takes the form of a brief page description, and 7 blocks which each contain a diagram; showing what the lights will look like, and an explantation of why this particular light will change colour.
